# Benefits of docker
- Every integration and automation uses a Docker image. You can specify the image to be used. Python versions for older images default to 2.7, but newer ones to 3
- The specified engine for the integration or automation starts the required container and injects into the container the Python code of the integration or automation.
- The system makes extensive use of Docker Engine, which uses Docker images to run integrations and automations as containerized applications.

# Docker image customization
`!DockerHarderningCheck` can be run to check whether the docker server image needs any hardening according to recomendations. It can also take params suchs as `memory="1GB"`

`Settings > About > Troubleshooting > Server COnfiguration` is the page where custom server config parameters can be added for hardening (or generally configuring) the enviroment.

The following are some common configs:
```json
"docker.run.internal.asuser": true
"limit.docker.memory": true
"docker.memory.limit": 1g
"limit.docker.cpu": true
"docker.cpu.limit": 1.0
"python.pass.extra.keys": --pids-limit=256££--ulimit=nofile=1024:8192
```
